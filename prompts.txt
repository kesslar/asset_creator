Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, there lived a young girl named Maria. She was an orphan and lived with her elderly grandmother, who was the village healer As the days passed, Maria realized that she had fallen in love with the ocean and made the decision to stay and make a life near the coast. She bid farewell to the traveler and found work at a local inn, where she could be close to the sea every day. Years went by, and Maria became known for her knowledge of the ocean and its tides, and she continued to explore and learn about the sea she loved so much. She lived a happy life, surrounded by the beauty of the ocean and the friends she had made in her new home.
